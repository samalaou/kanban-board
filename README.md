# React Kanban Board App

## Overview

This project is a simple task management application built with React. It allows users to create, view, and manage tasks across different status columns using drag-and-drop functionality. Please note that the application does not have a backend or persistent storage, so any changes made will be lost upon refresh.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop:** Move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop.
- **Add New Task:** Create new tasks and assign them to a specific status column.
- **View Task Details:** Click on a task to view more details about it.
- **Update Task:** Edit task details and save changes.
- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks from the list.

**Note:** All changes made to tasks will not persist across page refreshes as the data is only stored in-memory and loaded from a local JSON file
